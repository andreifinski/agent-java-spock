/**
 * Gateway to the {@link ReportPortalListenerContext}, which provides additional memoization facilities:
 * during the setting of the running item id this component additionally put it in the local LIFO data structure.
 * The main purpose is bypassing an issue with "mixing" of event tracking, i.e. using the current approach
 * the notification order can look like:
 * 1) beforeFeature/beforeIteration is called on {@link AbstractRunListener} -> item is tracked on RP and stored in context
 * 2) 'setup' method for iteration/feature from p.1. is registered - associated item is tracked on RP and stored in context
 * (item from p.1 is erased)
 * 3) 'setup' method is done - context is flushed
 * 4) As a result all trackable logging event during the fixture/iteration execution are missed due context emptiness
